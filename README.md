===============

Deciding Presburger arithmetic in agda.

* __problem/__ describes the set of formuli we plan to decide
  as well as the various subsets used during the decision
  procedure.


This repository is intented to be a cleaned up version of the
work done in Nottingham under T. Altenkirch's supervision. The
raw (and now broken) developments are still available on patch-
tag:

It is mainly based on Amine Chaieb and Tobias Nipkow's formalization
of a similar procedure in HOL.

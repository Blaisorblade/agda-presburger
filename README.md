# Deciding Presburger arithmetic in agda.

This repository contains a cleaned up version of the work done in
Nottingham under Thorsten Altenkirch's supervision.

It is based on Amine Chaieb and Tobias Nipkow's formalization of a
similar procedure in HOL.

# Dependencies

This development has been typechecked with Agda version 2.6.0, using
various extensions of the standard library currently waiting to be
merged.
